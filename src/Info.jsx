          A travel discovery and planning app for un-tourists, and a lifestyle
          brand for people who hate lifestyle brands, Dorsia uses fancy
          technologies to track down the places everybody wants to be, before
          everybody wants to be there.

        <h2>The Brief</h2>
        <p>
          To help Dorsia bring clarity to its original vision, develop a
          strategy, a visual identity, a voice and tone. To transform a rough
          idea and a rudimentary app into an elegant and irreverent brand, and a
          useful and beautiful digital product.
